# lsf-editor

this is the project file for the editor component

## Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Sass + CSS Modules

## Development

`nvm use`
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

## To do

- [x] remove basic scaffolding from vite template project
- [ ] keep current static-site build so we can host on Digital Ocean for testing / design
- [ ] configure Vite `build.lib` object so we can _also_ build the project as a library ([docs](https://vite.dev/config/build-options.html#build-lib))
